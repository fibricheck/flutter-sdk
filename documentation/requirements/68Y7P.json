  "description": "The `activatePrescription(<prescriptionHash>)` method in the SDK scans the prescription, links it to the authenticated user, and activates it in FibriCheck Cloud.  \nThis method takes the prescription hash as a parameter. The prescription hash is can be obtained by:\n- scanning a QR code that has been shared with the user out-of-band.\n- fetching a hash through FibriCheck Cloud API methods.\n\nThis function can throw 2 errors: \n- `NotPaidError`: A paying prescription has not yet been paid.\n- `AlreadyActivatedError`: The prescription has already been used."
